Prediction

🔥 Key Steps in the Project
Missing Value Handling: Filled categorical missing values with 'None', numerical missing values with median.

Feature Encoding: Label encoding for categorical columns.

Feature Engineering: Created new features and simplified some existing ones.

Model Used: Random Forest Regressor

Evaluation Metric: Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)

🎯 Results
Achieved a competitive score with Random Forest Regressor.

Improved model performance through careful feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

🌟 Future Improvements
Try advanced models like XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.

Perform hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV.

Add feature importance plots to better understand impactful features.

Deploy the model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.
